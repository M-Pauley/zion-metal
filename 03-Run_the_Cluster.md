# Create the Cluster
---

### Description:  
This section will create a starting MicroK8s cluster on our MaaS-controlled nodes to build on.  
Tasks for the Cluster:
- Install Microk8s and enable addons.
- Confirm and verify basic cluster operation.
- Create services for components that are not available as addons.
- Modify any service configurations as needed.
- Finalize the starting cluster operation.
- Install and configure GitOps CD system.
- 🎸🐓 Rock out! 🐓🎸


Nodes can also serve as KVM hosts and should be added in MaaS if you will need any VMs.
